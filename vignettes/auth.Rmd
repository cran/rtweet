## rtweet

This vignette covers how to obtain and use Twitter API access tokens
for use in the `rtweet` package.

```{r}
# install from CRAN
install.packages("rtweet")

# load rtweet
library(rtweet)
```

## Creating a Twitter App

- To create a Twitter app, navigate to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/)
and create a new app by providing a `Name`, `Description`, and
`Website` of your choosing (example screenshot provided below).
- **Important** In the `Callback URL` field, make sure to enter the
  following: `http://127.0.0.1:1410`
- Check yes if you agree and then click "Create your Twitter application".

- Once you've successfully created an app, click the tab labeled
  `Keys and Access Tokens` to retrieve your consumer (api) and secret
  keys.

<p align="center">
<img src="files/created.png" alt="created">
</p>

- To create a personal access token, users must provide their
  `Consumer Key` (aka "API Key") and `Consumer Secret` (aka "API
  Secret").

- I've highlighted the keys in the screen shot below.

<p align="center">
<img src="files/keys.png" alt="keys">
</p>

- Copy and paste these keys into an R script file and assign them to
  objects like I've done in the code below.

- Once the keys are read into R, use `create_token()` and store
  the output as `twitter_token`.

```{r}
## whatever name you assigned to your created app
appname <- "rtweet_token"

## api key (example below is not a real key)
key <- "XYznzPFOFZR2a39FwWKN1Jp41"

## api secret (example below is not a real key)
secret <- "CtkGEWmSevZqJuKl6HHrBxbCybxI1xGLqrD5ynPd9jG0SoHZbD"

## create token named "twitter_token"
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret)
```

*NOTE*: Following the steps outlined above, it's possible to create *multiple*
Twitter apps, resulting in multiple tokens. Twitter discourages
abusing their API rate limits (these are like speed limits,
regulating the amount of requests you can make within a given period
of time). Abusing Twitter rate limits can even result in Twitter
completely revoking your API access. However, Twitter does allow users
multiple tokens so long as each token is used for a unique purpose..

## Saving tokens

- At this point, you technically have enough to start using `rtweet`
functions---you'd just need to set the `token` argument equal to `twitter_token`
(the token object we just created).

- Rather than creating a token every time you open R, remembering
where you saved your token(s) or passwords, and specifying a token
every time you use a function, users are encouraged to save tokens as
an environment variable.

- To save a personal access token as an environment variable, save the
`twitter_token` object created earlier in your computer's home
directory (to locate your home directory, you can enter
`normalizePath("~/")` into your R console, or follow the directions
below for what I think is the easiest method).

- Use `saveRDS()` to save `twitter_token` to your home directory. The
  code below should locate and construct the path to your home
  directory for you. Assuming you've saved your token as
  `twitter_token`, the final line in the code below will save your
  token for you as well.

```{r}
## path of home directory
home_directory <- path.expand("~/")

## combine with name for token
file_name <- file.path(home_directory, "twitter_token.rds")

## save token to home directory
saveRDS(twitter_token, file = file_name)
```

- The last step is to create an environment variable that points to
the saved twitter token. This makes sure that the token will be read
and available to use every time you start R.

## Environment variable

- Create a plain text file containing the path to your token object
and save it to your home directory as ".Renviron".

- To create a plain text file in R, modify the code below. Change
`TWITTER_PAT` location to match the path you used earlier (in the
example below, you'd want to change "/Users/mwk/twitter_token.rds").
You can also create a plain text document in any text editor like
TextEdit or Notepad. If you're using Rstudio, select File >
New File > Text File.

- **Important**: Make sure the last line of ".Renviron" is blank. I
achieved this in the code below by including `fill = TRUE` in the
`cat` function.

```{r}
## On my mac, the .Renviron text looks like this:
##     TWITTER_PAT=/Users/mwk/twitter_token.rds

## assuming you followed the procodures to create "file_name"
##     from the previous code chunk, then the code below should
##     create and save your environment variable.
cat(paste0("TWITTER_PAT=", file_name),
    file = file.path(home_directory, ".Renviron"),
    append = TRUE)
```

- Restart R so it can process the environment variable.

- If you completed the steps successfully, you should be able to use
`rtweet` functions without specifying [or even *thinking* about]
tokens [ever again].

That's it!
